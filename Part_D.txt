The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is used to determine whether a time series is stationary or has a unit root, which implies non-stationarity. 
The null hypothesis of the ADF test is that the time series has a unit root (and is thus non-stationary). If we can reject the null hypothesis, 
it suggests that the time series is stationary.

Here's how you interpret the ADF test results for each variable:

1. **Log Nominal Exchange Rate**:
   - ADF Test Statistic: -0.7020
   - p-value: 0.8462
   - Critical Values: -3.4825 (1%), -2.8844 (5%), -2.5790 (10%)
   - Interpretation: The test statistic is not lower than any of the critical values, and the p-value is quite high (above 0.05). 
This suggests that we cannot reject the null hypothesis, and the Log Nominal Exchange Rate time series appears to be non-stationary.

2. **Log Real Exchange Rate**:
   - ADF Test Statistic: -0.6028
   - p-value: 0.8703
   - Critical Values: -3.4817 (1%), -2.8840 (5%), -2.5788 (10%)
   - Interpretation: Similar to the Log Nominal Exchange Rate, the test statistic is above the critical values, and the p-value is high. 
This indicates that the Log Real Exchange Rate time series is likely non-stationary as well.

3. **Log CPI Home**:
   - ADF Test Statistic: -0.1318
   - p-value: 0.9462
   - Critical Values: -3.4842 (1%), -2.8851 (5%), -2.5794 (10%)
   - Interpretation: The test statistic is not close to the critical values, and the p-value is very high. 
Therefore, the Log CPI Home time series is also considered non-stationary.

4. **Log CPI Foreign**:
   - ADF Test Statistic: -1.1901
   - p-value: 0.6778
   - Critical Values: -3.4870 (1%), -2.8864 (5%), -2.5800 (10%)
   - Interpretation: Once again, the test statistic does not fall below the critical values and the p-value is not low enough to reject the null hypothesis, 
suggesting that the Log CPI Foreign time series is non-stationary.

In all cases, the time series data for the logs of nominal exchange rate, real exchange rate, CPI home, 
and CPI foreign do not appear to be stationary based on the ADF test results. For such non-stationary series, differencing or transformation may be necessary before further analysis or modeling.

These results also have implications for economic analysis. Non-stationary data can lead to spurious regression results if not properly handled,
and it may indicate that the series is influenced by trends, cycles, or other non-stationary behaviors over time.


Given that the ADF test results indicate all the log-transformed series are non-stationary (since the test statistics are greater than the critical values, and the p-values are above the typical significance level of 0.05), we can't perform tests on the levels of the data for absolute or relative PPP directly. We need to address the non-stationarity first.

### For Absolute PPP:

The absolute form of PPP suggests that the real exchange rate should be stationary. Since your real exchange rate is non-stationary, you could:

1. **Differencing**: Create a first-differenced series of the real exchange rate and then re-run the ADF test to check for stationarity.
2. **Cointegration Test**: If the nominal exchange rate and price levels (CPIs) are both I(1), you could check for cointegration between them.

### For Relative PPP:

The relative form of PPP relates to the changes in the exchange rate and changes in price levels. So, you would:

1. **Differencing**: Create a first-differenced series for the nominal exchange rate and CPI, and then check if the changes in the exchange rate are explained by the changes in the relative CPIs through a regression model.

### Step-by-Step Approach

**Step 1: Differencing the series**

You would first difference all series and then check for stationarity again with the ADF test. 

```python
Master_df['diff_Log_Nominal_Exchange_Rate'] = Master_df['Log_Nominal_Exchange_Rate'].diff().dropna()
Master_df['diff_Log_Real_Exchange_Rate'] = Master_df['Log_Real_Exchange_Rate'].diff().dropna()
Master_df['diff_Log_CPI_Home'] = Master_df['Log_CPI_Home'].diff().dropna()
Master_df['diff_Log_CPI_Foreign'] = Master_df['Log_CPI_Foreign'].diff().dropna()
```

**Step 2: ADF test after differencing**

Re-run the ADF test on the differenced series to see if they are now stationary.

**Step 3: Regression Analysis for Relative PPP**

If the differenced series are stationary, you can then run a regression of the differenced nominal exchange rate on the differenced relative CPI (difference of home CPI and foreign CPI).

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Assuming the differenced series are stored as follows:
diff_nominal_exchange = Master_df['diff_Log_Nominal_Exchange_Rate']
diff_cpi_relative = Master_df['diff_Log_CPI_Home'] - Master_df['diff_Log_CPI_Foreign']

# Regression for Relative PPP
X = sm.add_constant(diff_cpi_relative)  # Independent variable
model = sm.OLS(diff_nominal_exchange, X).fit()  # Dependent variable
print(model.summary())
```

The coefficient of `diff_cpi_relative` in the regression model will provide insights into relative PPP. A coefficient significantly different from zero suggests a relationship between the exchange rate changes and relative price changes, thus supporting relative PPP.

**Step 4: Cointegration Test for Absolute PPP**

If after differencing, the ADF test shows the real exchange rate to be stationary, then absolute PPP may not hold in its traditional form. If the series are still non-stationary, you could look into cointegration tests between the levels of the nominal exchange rate and the relative CPI. This will require both series to be I(1).

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import coint

# Assuming the original log series are stored as follows:
log_nominal_exchange = Master_df['Log_Nominal_Exchange_Rate']
log_cpi_relative = Master_df['Log_CPI_Home'] - Master_df['Log_CPI_Foreign']

coint_t_statistic, p_value, crit_values = coint(log_nominal_exchange, log_cpi_relative)
```

For both regression and cointegration tests, you should include a constant term (intercept) in the regression equation. A statistically significant relationship (with p-values less than 0.05) would suggest that there is evidence for relative PPP in the differenced data or absolute PPP in the levels of the data if they are cointegrated.

Remember to use the actual column names from your DataFrame `Master_df` when implementing this approach. The results from these tests, combined with economic theory and other empirical evidence, will provide a more comprehensive understanding of PPP's validity for the currencies in question.
