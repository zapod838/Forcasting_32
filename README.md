# Forecasting the Real Exchange Rate: Indian Rupee (INR) vs Swiss Franc (CHF)

Welcome to our GitHub repository where we delve into a comparative study of the Real Exchange Rate between the Indian Rupee (INR) and the Swiss Franc (CHF), complete with a forecast extending one year into the future. This project is part of our coursework for EC6011: Business Forecasting in the MSc in Business Analytics program.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore various economic indicators and their influence on the exchange rates between INR and CHF. Utilizing a decade of economic data, we employ statistical and machine learning methods to predict future movements in the exchange rate, which is crucial for financial planning and analysis.

### Introduction

Over the past decade, India's GDP has grown significantly, making it one of the fastest-growing major economies globally. This growth impacts the INR and its exchange rate with other major currencies like the Swiss Franc. Our analysis includes a comprehensive look at the trade, investment, and economic policies affecting these two currencies.

### Objectives

- Analyze historical data to understand the factors influencing the INR-CHF exchange rate.
- Apply ARIMA modeling to forecast the exchange rate for the next year.
- Explore the implications of exchange rate fluctuations on trade and investment between India and Switzerland.

## Repository Structure

- `code_files/`: Contains all the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and modeling.
- `data_files/`: Includes the datasets utilized in our analyses.
